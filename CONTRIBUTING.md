### Fork the repository

First off, you need to fork the [thomasgouveia/vault-aws-credentials-helper](https://github.com/thomasgouveia/vault-aws-credentials-helper) repository in order to do your changes freely without affecting the original project.

> See [GitHub - Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

### Set up your laptop

Clone your fork on your laptop, and set up the tools needed to develop the project: 

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.20+)

For some fixes or features, you will need to configure a [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) in order to test your changes before submitting them. The easiest way to do so is to use one of the [examples](./examples/) provided in the repository. For instance, generally using the [examples/vault-with-userpass](./examples/vault-with-userpass/) will be sufficient. Please refer to the README present in the example folder to learn how to run it.

### Make a branch for your changes

Once everything is set up on your laptop, you can create a new branch in your repository and make your changes. Once your work is done, push it to the branch and create a pull request on the [original repository](https://github.com/thomasgouveia/vault-aws-credentials-helper).

Please review the [convention for commits and pull requests](#conventions).

**If you're creating a PR that is not ready to review, please do not forget to mark it as a draft.**

### Review process

Once the PR will be ready to be reviewed, ensure it is marked as ready. One of the project maintainer will review it when possible. If everything is ok, your PR will be merged into the original repository.
